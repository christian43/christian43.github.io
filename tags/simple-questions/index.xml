      <description>Simple Questions I love simple questions were the answer is more complex than expected. This is the first post about such simple questions. One of these question was asked by my wife during the olympic games 2021.
 Does it make a difference where the athletes have their oar in pairs rowing?
 In other words can we swap the athlete´s boat position without negative consequences? Similiar we can ask if there are side differences or site preferences within an athlete.</description>
