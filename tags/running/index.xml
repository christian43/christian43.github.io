      <description>What? Why? Okay - i started run again. This is the second run that i recorded this year. I decided to do a documentation that helps myself to stay motivated. Hopefully. Additonally i try to use my own running data and try some thing. Purpose? Yet i do not know. Maybe i can use it in my teaching lessons at the university leipzig or maybe just for my self to try a couple of R packages on this data.</description>
