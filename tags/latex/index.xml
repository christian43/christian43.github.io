      <description>QR Codes QR Codes are two dimensional &amp;ldquo;Quick Response Codes&amp;rdquo; presented first in the year 1994 by a japanese company. Nowadays QR Codes are widely used and a very effective way to transport short informations.
LaTeX offers a package called pst-barcode which can be used to generate several different barcodes. Here i tried to create a Vcard. Unfortunately the Vcard convention is somewhat strange in the behaviour. So sometimes android phones stick with that generated qr code.</description>

      <description>Serial Documents Often i have a task were i have to send documents or letters with an equal layout but different informations on it. The most prominient task surely are serial letters. To solve this task i use either MS Word or preferably LaTeX. The latter impresses with its excellent typesetting system.
What you need data source LaTeX template The data source often comes as a plain formatted csv file. Sure MS Word also reads Excel files directly.</description>
